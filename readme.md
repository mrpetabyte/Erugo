# Erugo

**Your Self-Hosted File Sharing Platform**

Erugo is a powerful, self-hosted file-sharing platform that puts you in **complete control** of your data. Built with PHP/Laravel and a Vue.js frontend, it offers secure, customisable file-transfer capabilities through an elegant user interface.

### Why Self-Host?

#### Your Data, Your Rules

Files stay on your infrastructure. No third-party access, no data mining, no surprises.

#### Deploy Anywhere

Run on your own server, VPS, or even a Raspberry Pi. Docker makes setup a breeze.

#### Open Source Forever

MIT licensed. Inspect the code, contribute features, or fork it for your own needs.

### Support Erugo's Development

If you would like to support Erugo's development, please consider donating to the project. Your support helps me maintain and improve the software.

## Quick Start

You can use the example docker-compose.yaml below to run Erugo in a container.

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: wardy784/erugo:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./erugo-storage:/var/www/html/storage # Use a dedicated folder
    ports:
      - "9998:80"
```

The above docker-compose.yml provides a basic configuration starting point that will get Erugo up and running with a default sqlite database.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

npm install
sail up -d
```

### Generate .env file

sail artisan db:seed
npm run dev
```

## Build it yourself

```sh
docker build -t erugo:local -f docker/alpine/Dockerfile .
```
If you would like to push the image to Docker Hub, run the following command. You will need to have a Docker Hub account and be logged in.
